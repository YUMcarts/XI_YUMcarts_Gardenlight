# Dr. Guadalupe Sudduth  
**Guardian of the Arriving**

She returns each year not for recognition, but for the face of the child she has never seen.

She prepares her classroom not knowing their names — but knowing their pain, their hunger, their confusion, and their brilliance.

And when others say, “You don’t have to go back,” she answers:  
**“They’re coming.”**

Because love doesn’t retire.
